       "['\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",

       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nMaster piece\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nMaster piece\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nMaster piece\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",

       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nMaster piece\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nMaster piece\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",

       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nMaster piece\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nMaster piece\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",

       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nMaster piece\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nMaster piece\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",

       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nMaster piece\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nMaster piece\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",

       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nMaster piece\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nMaster piece\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",

       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nMaster piece\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nMaster piece\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",

       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nMaster piece\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nMaster piece\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",

       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n']"

       "['\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don't know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nMaster piece\\n',\n",
       " '\\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That's all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n\"]"

       "'\\nDesign – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design. Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone. It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T. And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all. A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout. Remember Motorola? That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help. At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup. At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb. That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T. The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. And no, that’s not me advertising the charger. It really does work that fast. While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good. On the flip side, there is no headphone jack. I know, shocker! While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings. Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone. However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself. We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz. That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on. Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same. Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix. The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080. While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one. With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image. If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings. Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it. Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen. Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen. And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board. Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays. There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast. The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature. For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors. However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS. Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options. But these extra features are more than just a novelty. Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period. Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate. Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming. My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games. I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer. But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery. The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer. So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy. There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos. I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off. It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps. Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great. The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems. With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest. As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone. Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it. What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo. The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2). It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here. The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more. Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app. Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update. Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm). This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera. Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well. Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation. Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen. Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock. I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here. 90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition. While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it. Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication. It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone. While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices. The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use. With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\\n \\nThe  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place. AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T. So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen. Was little worried about the notch but it doesn\\'t bother me one bit. The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat. Didn\\'t really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you. You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life. Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don\\'t game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good. I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast. The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can\\'t complain for the money. Night pics and  macro are just great. The navigation gestures are a \\'nice touch\\'. I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it\\'s on the heavier side, but you get used to it. The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium. 1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it\\'s not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome. The volume is LOUD with a punchy base. I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1. The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2. My wife\\'s Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T\\'s ass in ookla speed test. Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).  I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3. The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics). Quality control not at it\\'s best.4.  Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.  It\\'s got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone\\'s pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade. Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5\\'s and 6\\'s are good capable phones too. But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\\n \\nI brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I\\'m giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don\\'t think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn\\'t like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020. As of now August 2023 it\\'s been 37 months for this phone still going well and good. Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates. Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device. Last updated in 2022 November.1. Cameras: There is not issue with cameras. Both front and back cameras are working properly.2. Display: very clear and no problem faced with display. The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn\\'t crack or broke.3. Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network. I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery. After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours. The device standby time is one day if you used moderate. There is battery drain because of 3 years of use. With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life. If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4. Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it\\'s okay still it gives louder volume.5. Durability: I used this device heavily. I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6. Network: initially I haven\\'t faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working. I don\\'t know what the exact cause to it. I have my carrier end issue too. It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That\\'s all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn\\'t made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n \\nUpdate 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn\\'t make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven\\'t used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\\n \\nI had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn\\'t slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I\\'ve never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That\\'s what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I\\'m not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won\\'t be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half\\'s backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it\\'s an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half\\'s usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It\\'s an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn\\'t face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn\\'t encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it\\'s a True Flagship device in the 30\\'s price bracket.I just don\\'t know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren\\'t a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can\\'t use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don\\'t find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it\\'s \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don\\'t try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won\\'t regret buying it.\\n \\nI have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I\\'ll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click \\'build\\' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing\\'s price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It\\'s recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\\n \\nMaster piece\\n \\nIts a fantastic phone. i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point. hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone. it has almost everything that you can  think of . from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers. if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you\\'re having budget of 42k and you\\'re going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you\\'re getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2. at this much price point, you\\'re getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion. and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you\\'re getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6. 8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn\\'t buy 64 GB Varient because if you\\'re a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series. so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3. the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4. the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don\\'t like cameras then we\\'ve really messed up\".  i think - \"if you like cameras then they\\'ve really messed up\". the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they\\'re saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you\\'re paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium. it is not the best midranger i would say. you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\\n \\nUsing this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point. Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too. Has got all the things needed for being water resistant. No wireless charging needed. And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium. And OnePlus 7T excels in this department. The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling. If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded. Not even for the back. I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box. With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue. It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present. And actually it\\'s not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone\\'s teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera. It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.  If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application. Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can\\'t be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus. It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn\\'t really spend that much time gaming on this phone. But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly. Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won\\'t feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point. People who say you can\\'t tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad. That\\'s all I can say. The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues. There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.  It\\'s so slight that it can\\'t be noticed just at a glance. But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone. And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone. Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day. Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.  Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time. The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour. It heats up a little bit during this process. But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point. So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\\n \\nOnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn\\'t feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world\\'s fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus\\' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world\\'s best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world\\'s fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T\\'s display\\'s color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device\\'s thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device\\'s thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don\\'t know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung\\'s S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple\\'s very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don\\'t ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.\\n'"

      "Design – A Familiar Face With a Dash of NewLet’s start with the design.\n",
      "Users of older Oneplus phones will instantly recognize the front side of the phone.\n",
      "It has the same teardrop notch that the company has provided in every phone since the Oneplus 6T.\n",
      "And honestly, it doesn’t bother me at all.\n",
      "A notch-less design would have been appreciated, but that’s reserved for the “Pro” model.But here’s the big twist- rounded triple-camera layout.\n",
      "Remember Motorola?\n",
      "That’s exactly what the Oneplus 7T looks like, and the “Triple Lens” carved right above the, well, triple-lens system, doesn’t help.\n",
      "At its best, it helps in distinguishing itself from the rest of the lineup.\n",
      "At worst, it sticks out, literally, like a sore thumb.\n",
      "That’s not to say that I haven’t grown into it, but given the Oneplus 7T Pro’s more predictable design, it does get me to ask “Why did Oneplus make it look like this?”The phone sports a single USB-C port which is used for charging using Warp CHarge 30T.\n",
      "The latest update to the charging technology will allow the phone to charge from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes.\n",
      "And no, that’s not me advertising the charger.\n",
      "It really does work that fast.\n",
      "While wireless charging would have been appreciated, I’m happy with decently fast wired charging if it’s this good.\n",
      "On the flip side, there is no headphone jack.\n",
      "I know, shocker!\n",
      "While most smartphones have ditched the headphone jacks by now, it still stings.\n",
      "Oneplus doesn’t add a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter here, so you’ll have to get one on your own if you don’t own a USB-C headphone.\n",
      "However, you can get yourself the Oneplus Bullets, a wireless headphone made by the company itself.\n",
      "We’ll be doing a separate review of that soon, so keep checking this space.Display – 90 Hz Master RaceIf there was one stand out feature on the Oneplus 7 Pro, it was its super smooth display with a refresh rate of 90hz.\n",
      "That combined with its clean android implementation made it one of the smoothest phones to, well, do anything on.\n",
      "Oneplus 7T continues that tradition, with the company promising that all of its future smartphones will implement the same.\n",
      "Other than that, the display is also equipped with HDR10+, so expect deeper blacks when viewing supported content from platforms like YouTube or Netflix.\n",
      "The display is a 6.5-inch FHD OLED screen, with a taller aspect ratio of 2400×1080.\n",
      "While that’s nice, I personally would have preferred a 1440p screen, having come from a Pixel with one.\n",
      "With that said, you can fill up the screen on apps like YouTube, although that does crop out the significant top and bottom parts of the image.\n",
      "If you’re looking for that then you’ll have to look at the Pro offerings.\n",
      "Oh and the display is flat, which while it doesn’t look as good as a curved one in photos, it does make up for being ergonomically easier to use practically.Coming to the 90 Hz refresh rate, I cannot state just how much better the experience of using the phone is because of it.\n",
      "Not only are all animations faster and smoother, but it even affects the readability of content on the screen.\n",
      "Even scrolling rigorously on the app drawer or an article, I could still discern the text that I otherwise couldn’t on a traditional 60Hz screen.\n",
      "And with most of the other phones slowly accepting this glorious change, I cannot wait for it to be implemented across the board.\n",
      "Another thing I hope to see is more games taking advantage of these faster chips and displays.\n",
      "There are even options to change the color space, with user control given a top priority here.The display hides a fingerprint reader under it, and it’s blazing fast.\n",
      "The success rate is pretty high, although it does tend to fail sometimes when the screen is awoken from the double-tap feature.\n",
      "For the most part, I used the facial recognition feature to unlock my phone, which I’ll talk about in the camera section below.Performance – Faster than The FlashWith a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ and 8 GB of RAM in it, it’s easy to look at this phone as having very similar specs as most of its competitors.\n",
      "However, there’s one thing those competitors don’t have: Oxygen OS.\n",
      "Longtime users of Oneplus phones will know that Oxygen OS is their custom version of Android, and compared to vanilla Android it comes with a few more customization options.\n",
      "But these extra features are more than just a novelty.\n",
      "Unlike other competitors like, say, Samsung these are features that I can actually see myself using more than once in the honeymoon period.\n",
      "Being able to change everything from the fingerprint animations to the touch gestures are a breeze.With the display being smooth as it is, it also helps that the 855+ (an overclocked 855) can easily keep up with the refresh rate.\n",
      "Animations never drop, and this is especially helpful during gaming.\n",
      "My model comes with a whopping 256GB of storage, which stands for one thing – More media, and in turn- more games.\n",
      "I’m no mobile gamer, but when the experience is this good one can’t help but try their hand at a few of the mobile games that many despise.The phone also has excellent RAM utilization, which translates to more apps being kept in memory for longer.\n",
      "But all this combined with the refresh rate does take a hit on the battery.\n",
      "The 3800 mAH battery gets me till the end of the day just fine, but if I toggle the refresh rate to 60 Hz, it lasts even longer.\n",
      "So for people who’re not comfortable with the newer display features can rest easy.\n",
      "There’s also a new “Video Enhancer” mode which aims to enhance color while playing videos.\n",
      "I personally didn’t find it to be a game-changer, so I turned it off.\n",
      "It generally pushes the colors but only works in certain apps.\n",
      "Other things like Night Mode and Reader Mode are just serviceable.Coming with Android 10 out of the box, Oneplus is aiming to update the firmware more regularly than ever before, and that’s great.\n",
      "The built-in Community app is great for finding peers to solve problems.\n",
      "With the current rate of update delivery, I expect the Oneplus 7T to last till Android 13 (or whatever it’ll be called) at the earliest.\n",
      "As far as community engagement goes, Oneplus is leading the charge here with even extended warranty support for its recent customers!Camera(s) – Three’s a CrowdNow, much has been said about the triple camera lens design on the back of the phone.\n",
      "Love it or hate it, but you can’t change it.\n",
      "What you can change is your POV when clicking a photo.\n",
      "The camera system consists of 48MP main lens (at f/1.6), 12MP telephoto lens (f/2.2) as well as a 16MP Wide-angle lens (f/2.2).\n",
      "It can record up to 60fps at 4K, but other features like slow-motion videos are not present here.\n",
      "The cameras themselves are just fine, but it did leave me wanting more.\n",
      "Having used a Pixel for the last 3 years, I was surprised at the slower shutter response in the main camera app.\n",
      "Hopefully, it’ll be fixed with a software update.\n",
      "Otherwise, I’m gonna have to use GCam here too however I can.Along with that you also get other features like Nightscape, Portrait mode and even a new macro mode, which can snap photos of subjects when the camera is super close to it (up to 2.5 cm).\n",
      "This is one of the most interesting, and unique, features of the camera.\n",
      "Nightscape is similar to, if not as fast as the Pixel’s Night Sight and the portrait mode works just as well.\n",
      "Here are some samples:Coming to the front camera, it’s a 16MP lens that can record up to 1080p, which is fine except when you use it in a high contrast situation.\n",
      "Funnily enough, every time I pointed either the front or the back cameras at such situations, an “HDR” notification popped up on the screen.\n",
      "Thanks Oneplus, I wouldn’t have known.But easily one of the best features of the front-facing camera is face unlock.\n",
      "I’ve used the same feature on a number of other phones but never as fast as it works here.\n",
      "90% of the time I double tapped to bring up the fingerprint icon, the phone instantly unlocked with facial recognition.\n",
      "While it can get annoying sometimes if you were aiming to just check the notifications, I didn’t mind it.\n",
      "Just keep in mind that it’s not as safe as using biometric authentication.\n",
      "It only works when you’re directly in front of the display, so odds are if you’re holding the phone in that orientation you were going to unlock it anyway.Verdict In conclusion, Oneplus 7T is a great smartphone.\n",
      "While the company has been increasing the phone’s prices every year, their phones can still beat their competitors at relatively affordable prices.\n",
      "The 7T’s design might not be its best, however, the software optimization makes it a breeze to use.\n",
      "With the clean Oxygen OS based on Android 10 & a super smooth 90 Hz screen at a lower price, the Oneplus 7T is at its best when it comes to Pro features for budget pricing.You can read more on TechQuila.co.in\n",
      " \n",
      "The  OP7T came intact and well packaged with seal in place.\n",
      "AMAZON could have done a better job on delivery, I had to wait 6 whole days for it to arrive....Anyways the phone is great, really a league above after the 3T.\n",
      "So have been using 7T since the past 4 days, and here goes my 2 cents on the phone.The first thing that I just fell in love with is that gorgeous screen.\n",
      "Was little worried about the notch but it doesn't bother me one bit.\n",
      "The screen is big and watching any content is a real treat.\n",
      "Didn't really notice at first any difference between the 90hz and a normal display, but it grows on you.\n",
      "You notice the smothness of the 90 hz during scrolling and gaming only though, and yes its hard to go back to a 60 Hz display.I do not know why all complain about the battery life.\n",
      "Now I am no power user, infact my usage is very basic or normal (i don't game much on phone), so battery performance has been veey good.\n",
      "I have used the display at 90 Hz all the time and have gotten in excess of 9 to 12 hrs (NO kidding) of screen on time  (see pics).Oxygen OS is as always light and fast.\n",
      "The UI is great as per the OP standards and am just loving the dark mode for most of the apps thru android 10.The cameras are good as well, can't complain for the money.\n",
      "Night pics and  macro are just great.\n",
      "The navigation gestures are a 'nice touch'.\n",
      "I have had success with the gestures about 80% of the time, then again I am getting used to the gestues.The phone is well built and balances in the hand well, though it's on the heavier side, but you get used to it.\n",
      "The design of the frosted silver looks very classy and the phone feels premium.\n",
      "1 star has been lost as there is a minor fade/mark on the back glass, but it's not big enough for me to notice always, so I give it a pass.Stereo speakers are just awesome.\n",
      "The volume is LOUD with a punchy base.\n",
      "I usually keep the volume on 80% or less most of the time.When using the phone charging took about 1hr 13 mins and with the phone off it took 1hr 3 mins from 0 to 100%.Now lets talk about the cons.1.\n",
      "The absence of the indicator LED can be felt.2.\n",
      "My wife's Moto Z play phone from 2017 kicked the OP7T's ass in ookla speed test.\n",
      "Even on wifi, miltiple times (suprised by this).\n",
      "I have faced no issues with signal strength or call quality during regular use.3.\n",
      "The little smudge mark on the back glass, on my OP7T (See pics).\n",
      "Quality control not at it's best.4.\n",
      "Split screen should have a shortcut option, navigation gestures should have been more accurate and other such minor things that OnePlus can tweak in software updates later.5.\n",
      "It's got a glass back people, so we all have to be careful not to crevasse the phone's pretty back.Verdict : Coming from a OP3T, this is a real upgrade.\n",
      "Anything futher than the 3 and it would be the buyers call, as the 5's and 6's are good capable phones too.\n",
      "But for the price tag and the package we are getting the OnePlus 7T is a great buy and I would recommend this phone to a friend.I hear the \"OP7TPro\" 😄 is launching soon, for those who can wait.....\n",
      "I brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review.\n",
      "As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues.\n",
      "Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU.\n",
      "If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time.\n",
      "If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour.\n",
      "Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery.\n",
      "But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.Delay in software updatesThis is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T..\n",
      "I will  update this in coming days.Review Edit after using 3year 1 month:I have been using this mobile since June 13 2020.\n",
      "As of now August 2023 it's been 37 months for this phone still going well and good.\n",
      "Initially it came with Android 10, and they have given 2 major Android updates.\n",
      "Now it is running on Android 12 and there is not more updates rolling up for this device.\n",
      "Last updated in 2022 November.1.\n",
      "Cameras: There is not issue with cameras.\n",
      "Both front and back cameras are working properly.2.\n",
      "Display: very clear and no problem faced with display.\n",
      "The device had survived multiple drops on roads, from pocket, from desk, table within 2 mtrs but it didn't crack or broke.3.\n",
      "Battery 🔋: The device comes with 3800 mah battery backup and Initially the it gave around 6 hours of continuous screen time on 4g network.\n",
      "I played games like pubg, call of duty, Asphalt 8 and watched YouTube.Right now the major drop off in this device is only the battery.\n",
      "After 3 years of heavy using it still gives you continues 3½ to 4½ hours.\n",
      "The device standby time is one day if you used moderate.\n",
      "There is battery drain because of 3 years of use.\n",
      "With same battery I can estimate that it gives you  2 more years of life.\n",
      "If I change the battery it would be another 3 years life for this phone as new one because there is nothing wrong with other software and hardware.4.\n",
      "Speakers: Speakers are well and good, I observed there is a decrease in volume compared to 2020 use but it's okay still it gives louder volume.5.\n",
      "Durability: I used this device heavily.\n",
      "I used it under rain ☔ more than 30 minutes for multiple times, I dropped it in 2 MTR depth water and it survived everywhere like speakers, sensors, body.6.\n",
      "Network: initially I haven't faced any network issues but after 2 years of using sometimes the internet stopped working.\n",
      "I don't know what the exact cause to it.\n",
      "I have my carrier end issue too.\n",
      "It happens only at my home, if I go outdoors there is no problem at all.Updates: OnePlus has stopped updates for this device, it locked at 12 Android and there are some glitches you can skip those as the phone is working with same speed like a new one.That's all about this OnePlus 7T.. after using this for almost 3 years 1 month I can say it didn't made me regret for buying this.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n",
      " \n",
      "Update 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong.\n",
      "No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration.\n",
      "Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly.\n",
      "Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10.\n",
      "Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch.\n",
      "I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device.\n",
      "Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too.\n",
      "Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back.\n",
      "It is a good camera but can be made better using the software.\n",
      "In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out.\n",
      "in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen.\n",
      "They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures.\n",
      "Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case.\n",
      "I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.\n",
      "I had been using Mi for the past 4 years.\n",
      "Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately !\n",
      "And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous.\n",
      "Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour.\n",
      "The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope!\n",
      "Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter.\n",
      "The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn't slip.\n",
      "It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones.\n",
      "The photo quality is great.\n",
      "Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too.\n",
      "The macro mode is something I've never seen on any phone before .\n",
      "The macros are so up close and detailed.\n",
      "Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable.\n",
      "That's what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I'm not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech.\n",
      "I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour.\n",
      "Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won't be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby.\n",
      "But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it.\n",
      "Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half's backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it's an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours.\n",
      "No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.\n",
      "[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half's usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display.\n",
      "Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern.\n",
      "Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours.\n",
      "You can calibrate the display as per your taste.\n",
      "The much hyped 90Hz display is true.\n",
      "You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ.\n",
      "90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box.\n",
      "What more can you ask for!\n",
      "Also the Oxygen OS is great.\n",
      "Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware.\n",
      "It's an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all.\n",
      "Check the Antutu scores.\n",
      "It just tops the list.\n",
      "Blazing fast speed and performance.\n",
      "Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag.\n",
      "Didn't face any hang or freeze issues so far.\n",
      "No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it.\n",
      "The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn't encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the \"Free 1-Year Extended Warranty\" .\n",
      "Yes you read it right.\n",
      "OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it.\n",
      "Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it .\n",
      "Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website.\n",
      "They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage.\n",
      "I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it's a True Flagship device in the 30's price bracket.I just don't know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren't a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can't use the phone while wirelessly charging it.\n",
      "I don't find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it's \"Unofficially\" fairly water resistant.\n",
      "Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube.\n",
      "But just don't try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won't regret buying it.\n",
      "I have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period.\n",
      "Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands.\n",
      "I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1.\n",
      "Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games.\n",
      "The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual .\n",
      "So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !\n",
      "!!\n",
      "), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2.\n",
      "The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat).\n",
      "Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it.\n",
      "The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3.\n",
      "Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range.\n",
      "I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level.\n",
      "Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode.\n",
      "Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this.\n",
      "Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4.\n",
      "Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5.\n",
      "Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers.\n",
      "The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6.\n",
      "Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed.\n",
      "0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7.\n",
      "UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick.\n",
      "one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1.\n",
      "Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less.\n",
      "They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed.\n",
      "Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them.\n",
      "They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2.\n",
      "Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life.\n",
      "It is decent at best.\n",
      "It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3.\n",
      "No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4.\n",
      "The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand.\n",
      "It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T.\n",
      "It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer.\n",
      "The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T\n",
      " \n",
      "Master piece\n",
      " \n",
      "Its a fantastic phone.\n",
      "i purchased this phone in august 2020. yes, you read it right i.e after the launch of the oneplus 8 and the oneplus Nord.The phone which truely stands out at this price point.\n",
      "hats off to Oneplus for making this amazing phone.\n",
      "it has almost everything that you can  think of .\n",
      "from ultra fast snapdragon 855+ to stereo speakers.\n",
      "if you wanna buy phone at this price point then go for it.let me cover something in detail:>>if you're having budget of 42k and you're going to buy ONEPLUS 8 then following things that you should consider-1.at a price point of 42k,you're getting a 6+128 GB varient, which is pretty expansive in my opinion.2.\n",
      "at this much price point, you're getting 48+16+2 MP camera - believe me or not, the 2MP camera is a scam and serves no purpose.3.Telephoto lens- which is capable of providing lossless 2x zoom is absent in oneplus 8.4. the 48MP camera is F/1.75 6-piece lens.all these things are making a phone really half-cooked in my opinion.\n",
      "and if you want to buy 8+128 GB varient then the price is 45k and 8+256GB costs a whopping 50K thats too much.>> let us have a closer look at the ONEPLUS 7T.1.at the price point of 36K-38K, you're getting ultra fast snapdragon 855+ which is as comparable to snapdragon 865.2. you are getting 48+16+12 MP cameras.3 the 48MP has F/1.6 Lens (7 PIECE)better than oneplus 8 and telephoto lens (12MP).4.Phone has stereo speakers as well.5.Phone has 90 HZ amoled display as well(same as the oneplus 8 )6.\n",
      "8+256GB priced at 38k that is 12k less than oneplus 8 .conclusion:-you can easily save 12k by buying oneplus 7T.>> for the people who are thinking to buy the oneplus nord-1.you shouldn't buy 64 GB Varient because if you're a person who take a lot of photos, then you might run out of memory.2.it is powered by a snapdragon 765G SoC which in not as powerful as snapdragon 8 series.\n",
      "so if you are game centric person,then this will disappoint you after an year or two.3.\n",
      "the chassis is made up of plastic- which means it lacks the premium feel.4.\n",
      "the display is not 2.5D curved( it is not mentioned on the official site as well, you can check oneplus india).5.the display does not  have any HDR10+ Certification.6.they are talking a lot about cameras and are saying- \"if you don't like cameras then we've really messed up\".\n",
      "i think - \"if you like cameras then they've really messed up\".\n",
      "the cameras are 48+8+5+2 MP.>>they're saying- the 48MP is taken directly from the oneplus 8 , but let me clear one thing, it all depends upon the image processing and ultimately the chip, and it is nowhere in comparison to the camera performance of the oneplus 8.>> 5MP depth and 2MP macro are just a scam and are of no use(see the megapixels).>> 8MP ultrawide is just ok.7.dual selfie cameras are good but again photos are not that sharp.and you're paying 28k or 30k which is sort of premium.\n",
      "it is not the best midranger i would say.\n",
      "you can definitely check out the realme X3 superzoom.>> you can also consider the oneplus 7T which doesnot have all these shortcomings for just 36k.hope this review helps a lots of buyers out there :)\n",
      " \n",
      "Using this device since it launched i.e from October 2019.Short review- I can confidently say that even for 2020,this phone is up to the mark,considering the price point.\n",
      "Due to its processor,90 Hz screen(You will see the difference),fast charging,I can say that it is future proof too.\n",
      "Has got all the things needed for being water resistant.\n",
      "No wireless charging needed.\n",
      "And with flat display and 20:9 aspect ratio,it sure feels like a premium phone.Detailed review-Body:- Gorilla glass at the front and back of the body is the perfect combination of making a smartphone feel premium.\n",
      "And OnePlus 7T excels in this department.\n",
      "The side portion is made of anodised aluminium which adds to this premium feeling.\n",
      "If you are the kind of person who is aware of the phone and does not drop it,then no case isneeded.\n",
      "Not even for the back.\n",
      "I use it without a case and it has been as pure as taken out from the box.\n",
      "With the frosted matte glass at the back,fingerprints will be visible more often in the grey colour of this phone but not on the blue.\n",
      "It is thin,it would have been great if the camera bump was not present.\n",
      "And actually it's not needed as mentioned by Jerry rig everything on his video of this phone's teardown.Camera- If you are the kind of person who likes vivid colours in a photo,use the stock camera.\n",
      "It takes out superb photos,both in daylight and at  night,thanks to its dedicated nightscape mode.There is colour inconsistencies between the three cameras,the main 48 MP camera being the most accurate one,followed by the ultrawide and then the telephoto.\n",
      "If you are the person who wants the colour accuracy,then go for GCam application.\n",
      "Only drawback in using GCam is that auxiliary cameras can't be accessed unless you root the phone.The top features of the stock camera app are the macro mode,the pro mode(it shows a love histogram),and the super stable mode.Super stable mode is just extraordinary combining OIS and EIS of the phones camera to deliver super stable cinematic shots.Software- There is no software that has more smoothness, consistency,features than oxygen os of OnePlus.\n",
      "It gives you all the option you need for which you might download applications from play store.Software-you can trust it BLINDLYGaming- I was a PC Gamer so didn't really spend that much time gaming on this phone.\n",
      "But a couple of hours of pubg and cod just ran smoothly.\n",
      "Phone does become warm after extended usage but with a case,you won't feel it getting warm.Screen & Speakers- These two blow out everyone at this price point.\n",
      "People who say you can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz are just sad.\n",
      "That's all I can say.\n",
      "The butter smooth swipe,scrolling makes it just a pleasant experience.Now some users are saying they are facing display issues,but for me,I did not face any such issues.\n",
      "There is a slight issue I can point out it that on extremely white surfaces and that too at specific brightness level,there is a sligh yellowish tint.\n",
      "It's so slight that it can't be noticed just at a glance.\n",
      "But amoled have such issues,so no complaints.And the stereo speakers are just so loud on this phone.\n",
      "And if you see the teardown of this phone from Jerry rig everything on YouTube,you will see that it has two speaker modules for the top earpiece which also acts as a speaker,which the apple or samsung phones also lack.Battery- Aah,the only drawback of this phone.\n",
      "Less than 4000mAh battery makes it last for a day.\n",
      "Getting a screen time of 8 hours without gaming in this covid lockdown.\n",
      "Normally it was around 12 hours of screen time.\n",
      "The ram management and battery management is so good that it learns how you use the phone and keeps those applications running,or background or force closes them.But with warp charge 30T,this charges from 0-70% in half an hour.\n",
      "It heats up a little bit during this process.\n",
      "But after 70%,there is no heating and charging is a bit slow in this area.In all,it a pretty all rounder phone given its price point.\n",
      "So far no complaints,no glitches with any legit application downloaded from play store.\n",
      "OnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro.\n",
      "Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium.\n",
      "But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece.\n",
      "Earlier the camera bump was very ugly.\n",
      "Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement.\n",
      "And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor.\n",
      "So everything is butter-smooth.\n",
      "This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices.\n",
      "Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect.\n",
      "This is really excellent.\n",
      "Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM.\n",
      "And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment.\n",
      "No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series.\n",
      "One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7.\n",
      "Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that.\n",
      "There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity.\n",
      "And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc.\n",
      "But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family.\n",
      "OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T.\n",
      "I am a little surprised about this.\n",
      "I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro.\n",
      "I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device.\n",
      "I think, this they may fix through updates.\n",
      "But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone.\n",
      "Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences.\n",
      "Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls.\n",
      "But the case is glossy/shiny.\n",
      "When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases.\n",
      "If not provided, no 100% display.\n",
      "I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup.\n",
      "This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top.\n",
      "One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier.\n",
      "I think they will add this feature in the coming updates.\n",
      "Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors.\n",
      "Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating.\n",
      "Now they have released two colors: blue and silver.\n",
      "But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant.\n",
      "This is frustrating.\n",
      "And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White).\n",
      "So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated.\n",
      "And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released.\n",
      "I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things.\n",
      "Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years.\n",
      "Samsung's S8/S9 is still current.\n",
      "J7 is still current.\n",
      "Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars.\n",
      "But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro.\n",
      "OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations.\n",
      "But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users.\n",
      "I recommend this to everyone.\n",
      "Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands.\n",
      "Blindly go for this.\n"
